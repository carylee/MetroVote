INSERT INTO "posts" VALUES(307,'DIAN ON THE ISSUES - Retire Sally Clark

For months, I''ve been laying out my vision of where Seattle needs to go to become a world class city that is a great place for everyone to live. But any campaign against a sitting elected official needs to explain two things: why its candidate would be a good elected official, and why the incumbent needs to be replaced.

Sally Clark, the incumbent in my race, is a nice person, a fine technocrat, and someone I respect. Unfortunately, she is a terrible Seattle City Council member. Here''s why:

She is not a leader. "Sally J. Clark is a milquetoast incumbent on the city council, petrified of voting against more than three of her colleagues at one time and beholden to any yokel who sends a nasty e-mail." -- The Stranger, June 14, 2011. When Clark was appointed to the council to replace Jim Compton in early 2006, she was selected from some 100 applicants in large part because she wouldn''t rock the boat. She was good to her word; in six years on council, she has almost never taken a principled vote against the majority. The Stranger again: "Clark dithers, she''s timid, she''s passive. She votes with the council''s moderate majority on every single issue."

Remarkably, according to a report last week in the political blog Publicola, council members are already planning to elect Clark and her "bureaucratic brain" as the next city council president. There are two problems with this: the arrogance of not waiting until voters actually elect Clark to another term, and the willingness to select someone with such poor leadership skills as the council''s leader. Clark should not even be a council member, let alone the council''s top elected official.

She confuses process with results. Sally Clark rarely acts on the citizen input she receives, but she does solicit input. A lot of it. Endlessly. Meeting after hearing after meeting. As chair of the council''s Built Environment (formerly Planning, Land Use, and Neighborhoods) committee, Clark has frustrated countless citizens who wanted to get involved and provide input. Sally Clark embodies exactly why so many people ridicule the "Seattle Way:" It''s a way of doing business that''s costly, inefficient, and most importantly, results in slow decision-making and bad decisions.

She has not been accountable. After being appointed in 2005,  Clark was reelected in 2006 and 2007 with minimal opposition. She has never really had to answer to Seattle voters for a host of positions that didn''t have public support. She was an early and strong supporter of a multi-billion dollar downtown tunnel option to replace the Alaskan Way viaduct, even after it was rejected by 70 percent of Seattle voters in 2007. Clark also voted for a controversial anti-panhandling ordinance, pushed a repressive anti-nightclub measure, and, while backing that expensive downtown tunnel, supported postponing permanent housing for the homeless and dramatically hiking Seattle parking rates during an economic downturn. 

Even after all her process, Clark''s voting record is a consistent reflection of the priorities of Seattle''s downtown establishment, and her donations also reflect this: for her current campaign, she has raised a staggering $236,655 as of Oct. 24, with her contributors'' list a who''s who of corporate Seattle. Unfortunately, many Seattle voters do not share those priorities.

She has no vision for the city. By going along to get along, Clark squanders the considerable power of a Seattle City Council member to help shape the future of what could be a world class city. Clark doesn''t have vision to do great things; she is a detail person in a job that requires the ability to see the big picture. Her skills don''t match her high-level job.

She personifies the larger problem with Seattle City Council itself. For years, the entire Seattle City Council has been a study in mediocrity, indecisivenes, lack of accountability and vision, and deference to corporate interests at the expense of ordinary Seattle residents. Too many people don''t think their voices matter in city affairs, and see no point in being engaged. On issue after critical issue facing Seattle, the City Council has been MIA for too long. Meanwhile, on projects dear to the hearts of special interests, the City Council has scrambled to accommodate every desire, no matter how expensive and no matter how little public support the project has. Only a city council as anemic as Seattle''s could contemplate naming Sally Clark as its president.

The last thing Seattle needs is a council member - let alone a council president - that isn''t accountable (except to special interests), that doesn''t have any real accomplishments, and that isn''t a leader. The best way to instead introduce new leadership, ideas, and accountability to Seattle City Council is for voters to retire Sally Clark on November 8.','facebook',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'154297187967305_225251710871852',NULL,'f','f','2011-10-27 01:07:25.000000','Elect Dian Ferguson','154297187967305',35,'2011-11-04 16:23:59.837605','2011-11-04 16:23:59.837605');
